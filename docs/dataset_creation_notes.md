# Dataset creation notes

Week order for the index has been taken from FabAcademy 2024.

Some sessions were not present in the Expert Network Map, so the most referenced websites could not be created. These are marked as empty in the file name. In particular, no information is available for the following sessions:

- Project Management
- System Integration

Machine design and mechanical design some years were on the same week. Other years, they were on different weeks.

They were also group tasks, so it's not clear which is the most referenced content, if the individual or the group assignment. In order to maximize the amount of useful information available, I will extract the linked assignments from the group assignments when linked from the individual assignment page.

When both subjects were on the same week, they have been added to the machine design file.

Embedded programming, machine design, mechanical design top experts were not shared at the Mattermost channel so they were created manually checking the [Expert Network Map](https://pub.fabcloud.io/project/expert-network-map/)

## Link checking

These links at Applications, Implications and project development, shared in the Mattermost channel, lead to the main profiles of the students. The content from the given assignment is not available.
